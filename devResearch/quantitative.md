# Constructing models


## What we offer

1. Quantitative predictions
  * making predictions shouldn't just be speculative and subjective. Although
  anecdotal evidence *is* important and *does* play into our model construction,
  it is vital that we have concrete numbers to make predictions. Coffee is sold
  by the *number of pounds*, salaries are paid in a  *number of dollars*,  and
  plant lifespan is measured in the *number of years*.
