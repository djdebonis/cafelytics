# Variable Analysis

## Independent variables

Many factors influence the production of coffee. These factors, or 'independent
variables' can be broken into two main categories: (1) environmental, or
situational/contextual variables, and (2) 'controllable,' or farmer-influenced
variables.

Although many environmental factors are out of a farm, plantation, or cooperative's
control, it is vital that we account for them to make accurate predictions about
production outcomes. These predictions often lead us to plans for preventative
actions/measures, some economic (e.g. putting aside profits in preceding years
to prepare for potential revenue losses), and others agricultural (e.g. adding
irrigation systems, investing in new land, etc.).

Environmental variables are also important because they influence how we
approach our 'controllable' variables. Below is a list of *some* of the
environmental variables we see influencing coffee production (quality, quantity
and consistency), as well as agricultural longevity and environmental sustainability.

### Environmental (for predictive/preventative measure)
* Weather
    * Average temperature
    * Rainfall
    * Sun
    * Freezing/frost

* Exposure
    * On a mountainside or flatland?
    * If on a mountainside, which side?
    * Shaded under a canopy or exposed?
      * shaded trees produce less annually, but they
      will produce for *far* longer (see also sow density)

* Pests
    * Coffee berry borers

* Geographical location
    * Latitude/longitude
      * associated temperatures
      * associated soil constitutions
      * associated humidities
    * Altitude/elevation
      * Weather & temperature
      * Rainfall & soil humidity
      * Wind
      * sun

* Plant ecosystems & intercropped plants
  * available nutrients

* Proportion of sun/shade
    * hours/sun per year

Although these variables are often predetermined and out of our control, all of
them interact directly and/or indirectly with the 'controllable' variables. For
example, some plantations are situated in geographical locations that receive
less-than-ideal rainfall. Although we cannot change the rainfall, we can investigate
the outcomes of constructing irrigation systems, and then decide if, when, and/or
how the investment would be returned.

There are many variables that *are* in our control, it is just a matter of
understanding how they affect the outcomes. Below is a list of some of the variables
that can be acted upon:

### 'Controllable' (for active measures)
* Sowing density (how many trees per hectare?)

* Intercropping

* Type
    * Genus (probably *coffea*)
    * Species: Arabica or robusta?
    * Strain: borbón, catauí, caturra, etc.

* Irrigation

* Fertilization

* Pruning

* Crop rotation

Both types of independent variables influence outcomes, or 'dependent variables'.
The most obvious outcome
is production quantity, because larger harvests/yields translate to larger revenue
streams. However, there are other factors that are vital when considering the
long-term sustainability of our fields, our business, our clients and professional
relationships, and the environment.

### Dependent variables

* Produciton: harvest yield (quantity)

* Production: harvest constitution (quality)
  * our clients chose us not just because we supply, but because we supply
  a consistent, quality product. Increasing and sustaining the quality of our
  product--while also delivering said product consistently--allows us to retain
  our client relationships, find new clients, and charge more for our product. 

* Production: harvest consistency (sustainability)


In short, coffee production is dependent on **a lot** of variables.
