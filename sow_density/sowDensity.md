# Sowing density and its effect on coffee production

## Sowing density

Sowing density--also known as plant density--refers to the spacing of plants or, in our case, coffee trees, relative to the area in which they are planted; it is generally measured in units of number of trees per area. For example, a one-hectare plot (area) with 2000 trees (# of trees) on it has a sow density of 2000 trees per hectare (trees/ha).

Sowing density does not necessarily denote the spacing of the trees, but just the density relative to the area of the land; the previous example with the density of 2000 trees/ha could imply a variety of spacings depending on meters between rows, meters between trees, and the orientation of the land (100m * 100m, 50m * 200m, etc.). Although these spacings *do* play a role in production outcomes, the focus of this brief article is strictly sowing density.*

## Sowing density and harvest yields

Harvest yield refers to the amount of coffee harvested, and--in our case--is often measured in units of kilograms per year (kg/year). Harvest yield may also be further specified to account for relative area, which leaves us with units: kilograms per hectare per year (kg/ha/year), which we will use moving forward in this article.

Sowing density plays a quite obvious role on harvest yields because more trees per area equals more coffee berries per area, which equals a larger harvest yield per area. Increasing sowing density--especially for farms that currently have a lower sowing density (less than 1500 trees/ha)--can be an effective strategy to make better use of space and increase production (and thus profit margins) without a massive investment like buying more land. However, a few key components should be considered:

First and foremost, just as more trees = more yield, more trees = more labor and investment. Increasing sowing density requires more labor-hours to germinate seeds, raise seedlings, transfer the saplings, tend to the plants, and harvest the berries; the land will also require more nutrients (and water, if the plants are irrigated) with a larger sowing density. It is important to weigh these types of costs against the increase in revenue streams while making a decision.*

Secondly, though, it is also important to consider how increasing the sowing density affects the production life of the trees.

## Sowing density and production life

Sowing density has a strong negative correlation with production life; i.e., as plots are stuffed with more trees, the trees' production cycles suffer. Although reseach in the field has not spoken to coffee specifically, sowing density generally decreases the production life and/or lifespan of the trees due to the proportional decrease in nutrients and water, as well as space to expand roots and foliage. (Sowing density also may affect the production potential of each individual tree, but this article will not cover this topic.)

Production life refers to the amount of years trees are in production. For most coffee trees, production begins around 4-7 years (give or take). The coffee trees will then produce a proportion of their full capacity for 1-3 years, and finally they will enter full production between 5-8 years.* The trees will then produce at full production for a period of time before they enter a sharp decline in anywhere from year 12-25.
